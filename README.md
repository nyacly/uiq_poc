## üöÄ Quick start (10 minutes)

| Step | Command | Notes |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| 1. Clone & install | `git clone https://github.com/nyacly/uiq_poc.git && cd uiq_poc && npm install` | Node.js 20+ recommended. |
| 2. Copy env template | `cp .env.example .env.local` | Set `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, Stripe keys, `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN`. |
| 3. Start PostgreSQL | `docker run --rm -it -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_DB=uiq_dev -p 5432:5432 postgres:16` | Or point `DATABASE_URL` at an existing Postgres instance. |
| 4. Apply Drizzle migrations | `npx drizzle-kit push` | Uses `drizzle.config.ts` to create/update the Postgres schema. |
| 5. Prepare Prisma | `npm run db:push` | Creates the local SQLite file Prisma/NextAuth relies on. |
| 6. Seed demo data | `npm run db:seed` | Populates Postgres with admin, business owner, member, and rich sample content. |
| 7. Launch dev server | `npm run dev` | Visit http://localhost:5000. |

### Seeded personas

After the seed runs, list the generated user records if you need to inspect seeded data or role assignments:

```bash
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -c "select id, email, role from users order by email;"
```

| Email              | Role        | Description                     |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| `admin@uiq.local`  | `admin`     | Platform administrator          |
| `owner@uiq.local`  | `moderator` | Business owner seeded for demos |
| `member@uiq.local` | `member`    | Everyday community member       |

Use `/auth/signup` (or `POST /api/auth/signup`) to create credentials for your own accounts, or configure Google OAuth to sign in with an existing email. Server-side routes now rely on NextAuth sessions instead of the development cookie shim.

---

## ü©∫ Health check

- Endpoint: `GET http://localhost:5000/api/health`
- Scripted check: `npm run health-check`
  - Continuous mode: `npm run health-monitor`

Both paths should return `{ "status": "ok" }` when the app, database, and third-party integrations are responding.

---

## üîê Authentication flows

- **Email & password** ‚Äì Call `POST /api/auth/signup` (or use `/auth/signup`) with `{ email, password, displayName }` to create an account. Subsequent logins go through NextAuth‚Äôs credentials provider.
- **Google OAuth** ‚Äì Set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`. When present, Google appears as a provider on the sign-in page.
- **Server-side usage** ‚Äì API routes call `getSessionUser()`/`requireUser()` which resolve the active NextAuth session and load role + membership tier from Postgres.

Automated tests can mint short-lived JWT session cookies the same way as `e2e/api-happy-path.spec.ts` does with `next-auth/jwt`.

## ‚úÖ Tests & quality gates

| Purpose | Command |
| ------- | ------- |
| Linting | `npm run lint` |
| Type checking | `npm run type-check` |
| Unit/API tests | `npm run test` |
| Playwright E2E | `npm run test:e2e` |
| CI-equivalent suite | `npm run test:all` |

Playwright composes signed NextAuth session cookies (see `e2e/api-happy-path.spec.ts`) to authenticate requests without bypassing RBAC.

---

## üß™ Webhook mocking (Stripe)

1. Ensure `npm run dev` is running.
2. Paste a user ID from the seed output into the payload below.
3. Send the request to the local webhook endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/stripe/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "customer.subscription.created",
    "data": {
      "object": {
        "id": "sub_test_local",
        "status": "active",
        "customer": "cus_test_local",
        "metadata": { "userId": "<uuid-from-users-table>", "tier": "PLUS" },
        "items": { "data": [ { "price": { "metadata": { "tier": "PLUS" } } } ] },
        "current_period_start": 1735689600,
        "current_period_end": 1738281600
      }
    }
  }'
```

A successful call responds with `{ "received": true }`. To test against Stripe‚Äôs CLI, run `stripe listen --forward-to localhost:5000/api/stripe/webhook` and export `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment (Vercel runbook)

Configure these variables in Vercel ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables for **Preview** and **Production**:

| Key | Why it matters |
| --- | -------------- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Primary Postgres database (Neon/Supabase/RDS/etc.). |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Full domain of the deployed site. |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | 32+ character secret for NextAuth JWTs. |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Enable Google OAuth sign-in. |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe secret key (live mode for production). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | Frontend key for Stripe Elements. |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Signature secret from Stripe dashboard. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN` | Required for interactive maps. |
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` | Twilio SMS delivery. |
| Optional analytics (`SENTRY_DSN`, `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID`, etc.) | Enable observability tooling. |
| Feature flags (`ENABLE_PAYMENTS`, `ENABLE_SMS_NOTIFICATIONS`) | Keep `true` to ship the full experience. |
| `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | Configure Supabase Storage uploads (`service_role` is preferred in production). |

> üí° Ship your Drizzle migrations (`drizzle/*.sql`) with every deploy. The CI/CD pipeline applies them before the Next.js build runs.

---

### üñºÔ∏è Media storage

- **Development** ‚Äì uploads remain local in `attached_assets/` and are served via `/assets/*` so existing URLs keep working.
- **Production/preview** ‚Äì when `SUPABASE_URL` and either `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` or `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are configured, `/api/uploads` streams files to the Supabase Storage bucket `public/uiq` and returns public URLs.
- **Bucket policies** ‚Äì create a Supabase Storage bucket named `public` with a `uiq/` folder and lock it down with:

```sql
-- Allow anonymous public reads for published media
create policy "uiq_public_read"
on storage.objects for select
using (bucket_id = 'public');

-- Limit writes/deletes to the service role (API enforces owner/admin rules)
create policy "uiq_server_writes"
on storage.objects for all
using (bucket_id = 'public' and auth.role() = 'service_role')
with check (bucket_id = 'public' and auth.role() = 'service_role');
```

The upload API already checks the signed-in user‚Äôs role, so pairing those policies with the service-role key keeps the bucket private while maintaining public CDN access.
