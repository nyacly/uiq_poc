2. **Implement Core Pages**: Directory, Events, Announcements, Programs, Opportunities, Classifieds
3. **Add Business Detail Pages**: Individual business profile pages
4. **Implement User Account Pages**: Profile management, messages
5. **Add Admin Panel**: Business verification, content moderation

## 📊 Overall Assessment

**Core Foundation: ✅ WORKING**
- Database setup and seeding
- Authentication system
- Home page with dynamic content
- UI components and styling

**Search & Navigation: ❌ NEEDS WORK**
- Search functionality broken
- Most navigation links lead to 404s
- Core pages not implemented

The application has a solid foundation with working authentication, database, and home page, but needs the remaining pages implemented and search functionality fixed.
